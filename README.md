# Beyond Dates

This project provides a comprehensive dataset and implementations for the exploration of machine learning models with techniques such as LIME, SHAP, and the use of ICLNet.

Dataset

The complete dataset used in this project has been uploaded to this repository. The data is organized in various files, which can be found in the main directory.
Non-Textual Analysis through LIME and SHAP

For the non-textual analysis of the data, we have employed Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHAPley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques. Both of these methodologies help in the interpretation and understanding of the functioning of complex machine learning models.

To access the implementations of LIME and SHAP, navigate to the folder named Non textual analysis through LIME and SHAP. Inside this folder, you will find all the relevant code files and results generated by these methodologies.
ICLNet Implementation

The repository also includes the implementation of ICLNet, a deep learning model, which is known for its effectiveness in various tasks.

To delve into the ICLNet implementation, please refer to the ICLNet folder in this repository. The folder contains all the necessary code files and scripts used to run the ICLNet model on our dataset, along with the results generated by the model.
Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the respective folders for different implementations. Ensure you have the necessary computational environment and packages installed to run these scripts. Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for more specific instructions about how to run the code.
